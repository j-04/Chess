# Chess

### The project was finished a year ago. The main goal was to create simple core of chess and to practice OOP skills and there is a lot of shitty code. After a year i decided to practice some patterns such as Builder, Factory and Singleton finally to make my code cleaner. I know that there is a lot of govno code and that i could have used only the Factory template without Builder, but practice is practice, it makes programmers better.
